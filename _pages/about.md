Welcome! My name is Sascha Nievelstein and I am especially passionate about everything related to Computer Science, Economics and Psychology. That's how I ended up specializing and working a lot in all kind of blockchain-related fields in the last couple of years.

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and one in Management, Business and Economics at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). Following my passion of self-improvement and blockchain topics, I am currently also working as a developer at [Dopamining](https://dopamining.io/). I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) and did an exchange semester at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
